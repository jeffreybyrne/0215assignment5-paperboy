    # Every day, each paperboy is given a house number to start at and a house number to finish at. They get paid $0.25 for every paper they deliver and $0.50
    #for every paper over their quota. If at the end of the day they haven't met their quota, they lose $2.
    #
    # The minimum number of papers to deliver is 50. The quota is calculated as half of your experience added to the minimum. So the first time a paperboy
    #makes a delivery, the quota is 50. The next time, the quote is 50 plus half the number of papers that the paperboy has delivered in the past. In this way
    #the quota should increase after every delivery the paperboy makes.

    #paperboy's experience! Let's assume that the start_address is always a smaller number than the end_address
    def deliver(self,start_address,end_address):
